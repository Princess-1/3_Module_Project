# Module_3_Project
## The Project
Chicago is a busy city packed with traffic. All of this traffic dramatically raises the risk of a major car accidents on any given roadway. According to statistics from the Illinois Department of Transportation, there were **98,859** car accidents in the city of Chicago in 2018. Of these, **121** accidents resulted in fatalities and **17,732** caused injuries. A total of **132** people died in traffic accidents that year, and **24,400** were injured. Approximately **2,600** of the reported injuries were serious or life-threatening, and **14,010** involved visible injuries that did not incapacitate the victim. The high volume of traffic accidents, injuries, and deaths leads one to question: **What are the main causes of car accidents in Chicago?**
